                <p>
                    I'm a first generation American, born and raised in the Bay Area.
                    I graduated from San Jose State University with a major in Business Management.
                    Shortly after, I landed a job at NASA Ames Research Center where I quickly started working
                    on Space and Aircraft Missions. My passion for learning continued to florish
                    so thats when I made the decision to advance my studies and learn Programming and Web
                    Development.

                    In my spare time I love to spend time with my dogs, visit the beach and try new resturants.
                    Im also huge into Halloween, scary movies, and Super Natural.
